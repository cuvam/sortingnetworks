A basic C program that reads the contents of a .txt file for pairs of compare-swap operations that form a sorting network. Currently it applies the sort to an array of size 64, but feel free to download and alter the code to your liking to fit any size or use any other sorting network.

The network included with this code was obtained from https://bertdobbelaere.github.io/sorting_networks_extended.html.
